          <h1>I blew $720 on 100 notebooks from Alibaba and started a Paper Website business</h1><p class="paragraph"> <i>December 14th 2021</i> </p><p class="paragraph"> TLDR; I started a business that lets you&nbsp;<a href="https://paperwebsite.com/" target="_blank">build websites using pen &amp; paper</a>. In the process I went viral on Twitter, made $1,000 in two days, and blew $720 on 100 paper notebooks from Alibaba. </p><h3>📖&nbsp;Can you build a website from a piece of paper?</h3><p class="paragraph"> One day, a riddle popped into my brain: </p><p class="paragraph"> <i>"Can you build a website from a piece of paper?"</i> </p><p class="paragraph"> I'm a man who&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/mailoji" target="_blank">once bought 300 emoji domain names from Kazakhstan,</a>&nbsp;but, even to me, the idea of building a website from a piece of paper seemed a&nbsp;<i>bit</i>&nbsp;strange. </p><p class="paragraph"> Around this time though, I'd been planning to start a brand new daily blog. </p><p class="paragraph"> I began picturing myself in a dressing gown, with a cup of tea and a biro, somehow writing this online blog from a page in a notebook. </p><p class="paragraph"> This idea seemed&nbsp;<i>very</i>&nbsp;funny. </p><p class="paragraph"> Can you build a website from a piece of paper? I decided to at least try it. </p><h3>🧙‍♂️&nbsp;Paper website experiment #1</h3><p class="paragraph"> Feeling confident, I got out some paper and wrote down a chorus from&nbsp;<i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i>&nbsp;(don't ask). </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> If I could transform these handwritten words into pixel words, then it wouldn't be too hard to convert that into the HTML code for a website. </p><p class="paragraph"> I took a photo of the page with my phone, and eagerly fed the image into some software that could recognise handwriting. </p><p class="paragraph"> A few moments later, I had the results. </p><h3>😱&nbsp;These results may shock you</h3><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> There were a lot of mistakes. </p><p class="paragraph"> Despite being left-handed and smudging every birthday card I've ever written in, my handwriting is quite neat, so a paper website was not looking promising. </p><p class="paragraph"> The software kind of understood my words, so I wondered if I could just fix the spelling mistakes somehow. </p><p class="paragraph"> All I needed was a really good spellchecker. </p><h3>🤖&nbsp;A really good spellchecker</h3><p class="paragraph"> GPT-3 has been hailed a breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence. </p><p class="paragraph"> Billions of parameters work together like a human brain. It can generate whole books, brand new ideas, and chat like a human. </p><p class="paragraph"> I needed it for one thing, and one thing only: to be a glorified spellchecker. </p><p class="paragraph"> My idea was to feed this world-class AI sentences with spelling mistakes, and examples of how they should be corrected. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> With some luck, it should then learn how to fix mistakes on all future sentences for my paper website. </p><h3>🧪&nbsp;Paper website experiment #2</h3><p class="paragraph"> I strapped GPT-3 onto my handwriting recognition code, and retried the experiment. </p><p class="paragraph"> <b><i>&gt; Snap picture. Upload. Cross fingers.</i></b> </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> Somehow, it worked! </p><p class="paragraph"> It didn't take too much extra effort to build a small prototype that let me upload a photo of my page, turn it into code, and host it on a tiny website. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> I also built a basic editor that let me add links, images and headings to make the website more interesting. </p><p class="paragraph"> Can you build a website from a piece of paper? It seemed like it. </p><p class="paragraph"> Was it practical to use paper for a&nbsp;<i>real</i>&nbsp;website though? No idea. </p><h3>🌄&nbsp;The first ever paper website</h3><p class="paragraph"> A few days later, I set off for a week's holiday in the Peak District. Being me, I thought this would be the perfect time to build a test paper website about the trip. </p><p class="paragraph"> On the first morning, I got up early and began writing my website on paper. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> My girlfriend watched me, puzzled. After convincing her that I hadn't gone crazy, I proudly took a photo of my page, and sent her the URL of my newly created paper blog post. </p><p class="paragraph"> Although this was the lamest mic drop of all time, I think she was impressed. </p><h3>📝&nbsp;One week of paper blogging</h3><p class="paragraph"> Every morning I kept adding to my new paper website until I had written a&nbsp;<a href="https://weekinthepeaks.com/" target="_blank">whole tiny travel blog</a>&nbsp;about the trip. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> Despite no one reading it, I found myself genuinely looking forward to writing a new post each morning. </p><p class="paragraph"> I wrote more without the distractions of the internet, and it was refreshing not being in front of a screen. It was also just really fun. </p><p class="paragraph"> This made me wonder: </p><p class="paragraph"> If I enjoyed this way of building websites, perhaps others would too? </p><h3>💻&nbsp;Starting a paper website business</h3><p class="paragraph"> Fueled by the excitement of my paper travel blog, I decided to start a service that would let anyone build their own paper website. </p><p class="paragraph"> Over a few weeks I fleshed out my prototype. I built an app for easily taking paper pictures, and created a payment system using Stripe for subscriptions. </p><p class="paragraph"> The last step was choosing a name. Fortunately,&nbsp;<a href="https://paperwebsite.com/" target="_blank">paperwebsite.com</a>&nbsp;was available for £10, so I creatively called my service:&nbsp;<a href="https://paperwebsite.com/" target="_blank">Paper Website.</a> </p><p class="paragraph"> Now I just needed some customers. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><h3>🏷️&nbsp;Marketing tips from the top</h3><p class="paragraph"> To entice some potential customers, I decided to conjure up&nbsp;<i>the ultimate deal.</i> </p><p class="paragraph"> For $99, you'd get a year long paper website, and a free Moleskine notebook to build your website in. </p><p class="paragraph"> It was everything you needed to start your own paper website (although arguably, a pen might also be useful). </p><p class="paragraph"> I started dropping links everywhere to spread the good word. </p><h3>📈&nbsp;Mysterious traffic</h3><p class="paragraph"> One afternoon, I was sat in a cafe ready to chow down on some serious work. </p><p class="paragraph"> I briefly opened Google Analytics, and noticed that for some reason there were 30 people on paperwebsite.com. </p><p class="paragraph"> This was a lot more than the usual 0 website visitors.&nbsp;<i>Things</i>&nbsp;were happening. </p><p class="paragraph"> After some investigation, I found that Paper Website had randomly been featured as a tiny footnote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://thehustle.co/%E2%9B%B3-golf-is-blowing-up/" target="_blank">massive newsletter.</a> </p><p class="paragraph"> Just as I cracked the case, something amazing happened. </p><h3>🎉&nbsp;First customer</h3><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> I watched as Paper Website went from £0 in sales, to £7 as it got its first monthly subscription customer. </p><p class="paragraph"> I let out a tiny fistpump in the middle of the cafe that I desperately hope no one saw. </p><p class="paragraph"> It wasn't over yet though. Soon after, somebody was lured in by&nbsp;<i>the ultimate deal.</i> </p><p class="paragraph"> I had two customers! Now my girlfriend was impressed: </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> I was the Dunder Mifflin of the internet. </p><h3>🚚&nbsp;Notebook woes</h3><p class="paragraph"> My new users began building their paper websites, whilst I realised I now had to ship somebody a Moleskine notebook as part of&nbsp;<i>the ultimate deal.</i> </p><p class="paragraph"> I loaded up the Moleskine website and saw this was going to cost a staggering $30. </p><p class="paragraph"> Paper Website would go bankrupt at these prices, so somehow I needed to reduce costs. </p><p class="paragraph"> Then I wondered: could I just create my own notebooks? </p><h3>💳&nbsp;Buying 100 custom notebooks</h3><p class="paragraph"> I opened my browser and went to Alibaba.com. Ten minutes later I was talking to the&nbsp;<i>Jiaxing Banana Import &amp; Export Co.</i>&nbsp;- apparent experts in creating notebooks. </p><p class="paragraph"> Their minimum order was 100 notebooks at $3.25 each. I could even have a custom logo on the front. </p><p class="paragraph"> This was a point of no return. By purchasing these notebooks I was commiting to an idea that had only been validated by 2 sales. Shipping was also $395. </p><p class="paragraph"> But hey, it would be really cool to have my own notebooks. </p><p class="paragraph"> I clicked buy. They'd arrive in 4 weeks. </p><h3>📦&nbsp;Notebook Delivery</h3><p class="paragraph"> One month later, two large brown cardboard boxes arrived on my doorstep. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="\" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> I eagerly cracked them open to see what on earth I'd purchased. </p><p class="paragraph"> Fortunately, the&nbsp;<i>Jiaxing Banana Import &amp; Export Co.</i>&nbsp;hadn't let me down. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> 100 white notebooks, each with my logo on the front. They were the perfect operating system for my paper-based internet. </p><p class="paragraph"> My brief, unofficial partnership with Moleskine ended, and I proudly added the new notebooks to my website. </p><h3>📆&nbsp;Preparing for launch</h3><p class="paragraph"> Now I had 100 notebooks sat in my kitchen, I needed to actually sell them, otherwise a lot of my family would be getting notebooks for Christmas. </p><p class="paragraph"> I decided the best plan would be to generate some hype and do a big launch. </p><p class="paragraph"> Over the next week I fine tuned my website, and created a video to try and explain to the public what on earth this paper website thing was. </p><div class="embed"></div><p class="paragraph"> On November 10th 2021, I typed up a launch tweet. </p><p class="paragraph"> Then, I tweeted it. </p><h3>💸&nbsp;Going viral on twitter</h3><p class="paragraph"> It couldn't have gone better. The tweet&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/tinyprojectsdev/status/1458414762203795460" target="_blank">blew up.</a> </p><p class="paragraph"> It quickly spread from my little following to other people on twitter, getting 230k impressions, over 1500 likes, and 300 retweets. </p><p class="paragraph"> More importantly though, I was selling some paper websites! </p><p class="paragraph"> Over 2 days I sold 11 subscriptions netting ~$1000/yr in revenue, a lot of them were&nbsp;<i>the ultimate deal</i>. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><h3>🎊&nbsp;Launch success</h3><p class="paragraph"> After finishing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/paper-website">4th on Product Hunt</a>&nbsp;a few days later,&nbsp;Paper Website was sitting at a modest ~$3,600/yr in subscriptions. </p><p class="paragraph"> Loads of people had also now started to build their own paper websites. </p><p class="paragraph"> There were websites about&nbsp;<a href="https://doughnuts.design/" target="_blank">game design</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://angry-catfish-36.web.app/" target="_blank">puzzles</a>, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://thirasoap.com//" target="_blank">making soap</a>&nbsp;- all created from pen &amp; paper. It was so awesome to see. </p><p class="paragraph"> Can you build a website from a piece of paper? People were doing it right now! </p><h3>📬&nbsp;Becoming a mailman</h3><p class="paragraph"> When the chaos died down, I bought some padded envelopes, and started packaging my notebooks into them. </p><p class="paragraph"> Then, I opened my door, walked down the road, and posted the first ever paper website notebook to someone in London. </p><p class="paragraph"> This was a surreal experience, when I first imagined a paper website, I never expected things to go this far. </p><p class="paragraph"> But, here I was. This is where my story ends, standing in the middle of a random street in England, dropping a notebook into a Royal Mail postbox. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><h3>📘&nbsp;The end</h3><p class="paragraph"> The other day my dad (who's a farmer) tried out Paper Website, and created a&nbsp;<a href="https://red-chicken-48.web.app/" target="_blank">page</a>&nbsp;about building a gate out of horseshoes. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> Although I still have a big box of notebooks in my kitchen, what I'm really excited about is seeing more websites like his. </p><p class="paragraph"> There's a lot of weird, wonderful and interesting ideas out there (like horseshoe gates) that never make it to the internet. Perhaps if starting a website was as simple as picking up a pen, we might see more of them. </p><p class="paragraph"> Unknowingly stumbling across someone's paper website also sounds like a lot of fun, and I think the internet should be more fun. </p><p class="paragraph"> By the way, I did end up starting my new daily blog. </p><p class="paragraph"> I'm currently sat in my dressing gown, with a cup of tea and a biro, writing my latest post for it right now on a piece of paper. </p><p class="paragraph"> It's called:&nbsp;<i>I blew $720 on 100 notebooks from Alibaba and started a Paper Website business.</i> </p><p class="paragraph"> You've been reading a paper website this whole time. </p><figure class="fig-img"><img class="img   " src="" alt=""><figcaption class="fig-cap"></figcaption></figure><p class="paragraph"> I make&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/">tiny projects</a> </p>
