    <div>When <span id="p1" class="selected">new</span> members join The Rotary Club of Spruce Grove, the club asks that they give a classification speech
        sometime during their first year of membership.&nbsp; Rotary uses the classification system to categorize each
        member's chosen vocation or profession, and our club strives to seek a balanced representation of the business
        and professional landscape of our community.&nbsp; <a
            href="https://sprucegroverotary.org/sitepage/member-handbook/the-classification-system" target="_blank">You
            can learn more about Rotary's classification system here</a>.</div>

    <div>&nbsp;</div>

    <div>A classification speech is intended to help us get to know you better.&nbsp; This is a rough guide you may wish
        to use in designing your classification speech, which should be about 20 minutes in length.&nbsp; Feel free to
        be creative and deal with the parts of your life that you are more interested in or proud of.&nbsp; Please speak
        to what makes you most relaxed and comfortable.&nbsp; You're among friends!&nbsp; This is not intended to be any
        form of test or challenge.&nbsp; If you need help, talk to anyone in the club for further information or advice
        in preparing.&nbsp; It bears repeating: feel free to get creative!&nbsp; You may use pictures or videos to tell
        your story or even ask your sponsor or someone else in the club to engage with you in a Q &amp; A,
        interview-style classification speech if you think that would make you more comfortable.&nbsp; After your
        speech, we'll have 5-10 minutes for members to ask you questions to get to know you better.</div>
