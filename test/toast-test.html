            Paving the Way for Innovation in Connectivity for Nearly Half a Century
For almost half a century, IEEE 802 working groups have paved the way for technological connectivity in how people live, work, and communicate, and in 2023, the 802.3 series of standards celebrate a significant anniversary.

In honor of the 50th anniversary of Ethernet, we’re recognizing IEEE 802.3 milestones and the innovation that is shaped by these standards. Particularly, we thank the thousands of volunteers who have worked tirelessly over the years to help shape the future of Ethernet technology and serve the industry and society needs.

Interested in joining any of the 802 working groups? We invite people from around the world to join any of the 802 working groups in advancing networking technologies for the benefit of humanity.

What is IEEE 802?
The founders of the IEEE Local Area Network Standards Committee (LMSC) began discussing standardization opportunities in 1979, submitting a project proposal “Local network for Computer Interconnection” through the IEEE Computer Society to the IEEE in August 1979 that was formally approved by the IEEE on 13 March 1980. Today, the IEEE 802 LMSC develops and maintains networking standards and recommended practices for local metropolitan, and other area networks using an open, consensus-driven standards development process, and advocates them on a global basis.

Currently, the IEEE 802 family of standards consists of 67 published standards with 49 projects under development. The most widely used IEEE 802 standards are for Ethernet, Bridging and Virtual Bridged LANs Wireless LAN, Wireless PAN, Wireless MAN, Wireless Coexistence, Media Independent Handover Services, and Wireless RAN with a dedicated Working Group providing focus for each area.

IEEE 802 also coordinates with other national and international standards bodies, including ISO which has published certain IEEE 802 standards as international standards. Moreover, the IEEE 802 LMSC and working groups garner strong international participation with ongoing meetings and sessions being held throughout the world.
